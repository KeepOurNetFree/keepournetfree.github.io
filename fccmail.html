					Dear Chairman Pai and Others,
					<br><br>
					The Internet is the jewel on the crown of all modern technology. It has shaped and changed our country and spread outward to the entire world. It has brought together people and cultures, enriched democracy and fostered understanding. Through the Internet we share our lives, our educations, and for the past two decades, our products. It is not a product, it is a space created by the contributions of every computer that connects to it.
					<br><br>
					The Internet is a true manifestation of a global commons, and without protection, it will suffer the worst form of tragedy: one of greed and indifference to responsibility. Rolling back the 2015 Common Carrier rules will open the flood gates to those who would twist this commons for their own gain without respect to the people who rely on the Internet every single day. People it is your job to protect from predatory corporate behaviors.
					<br><br>
					The Internet is part of how we live now. Just as much as the roads we drive on, the stores we shop in, and the air we breathe. It has become a primary route by which Americans work, apply for jobs, access government services, purchase goods, and educate ourselves.
					<br><br>
					When you take protections away from the Internet, you take protections away from every citizen of America, and promote disregard for the protections of our allies in other countries. Every rule and law that effects the Internet in America trickles outward to touch the world. It is a heavy burden, sure, but it is ours to bear.
					<br><br>
					Please consider the following likely outcomes to the 2015 Common Carrier rules being withdrawn without a substitute of equal ethical quality taking its place:
					<br><br>
					1. Information Suppression
					<br><br>
					Internet Service Providers will become the ultimate arbiters of what data passes across their network, by leveraging addition or reduced costs to content that is beneficial to their bottom line.
					<br><br>
					Ex. Hiding information about political candidates they do not want in power, or hiding criticisms of a candidate to prevent public awareness of criminal or immoral activity. If nobody can acknowledge a flaw, the flaw doesn't exist.
					<br><br>
					Ex. Distorting public knowledge of the news, science, or government activities, to prevent the public from making informed judgments about their own lives and how they vote. If you can't see information, it doesn't exist, and if the informed cannot afford an excessive fee to share information with the uninformed, it may never been seen.
					<br><br>
					Ex. Limiting information about competing services to prevent subscribers from benefiting from the free market. If you can't see a sale, it doesn't exist. If no subscribers can find alternatives, the free market fails them.
					<br><br>
					2. Priority Service Monopolies
					<br><br>
					Before the 2015 Common Carrier rules change, large ISPs began to offer services that competed against 3rd party companies which could not benefit from equivalent infrastructure, much of which was subsidized with American tax money.
					<br><br>
					Ex. Imagine a country of highways like the United States of America, but there is only one road between each city. Along these roads, every corporation has total control of their length of the street. Everyone travels on these roads, to work, to play, to school, and to visit family.
					<br><br>
					Now imagine one corporation sets up a toll booth on their section. Everyone has to drive through that toll booth, leaving no alternative but to build entirely new roads for themselves. Keep in mind, this is the same public who subsidized those roads initially. Now, imagine what happens after every other corporation realizes they could be making more money in this same manner.
					<br><br>
					The end result is an entire nation of toll roads where every citizen and corporate competitor has to pay the penalty. You get up in the morning and have to pay a toll to exit your driveway, then another to change neighborhoods, then one on every mile of road you travel down to work. Then again on the way back.
					<br><br>
					3. Anti-Competitive Behavior
					<br><br>
					In addition to the priority service loopholes, you also see corporations eliminating all small business competitors before they can barely begin to compete. This will lead to a stifled market with little innovation, that will then fall into disrepair and strand the United States of America in the wake of countries that continue to develop their information technologies.
					<br><br>
					Ex. Comcast decides to compete directly with Netflix, so they create a streaming video service, and then charge Netflix ten times the usual bandwidth fee while arguing that it is in favor of a free market. Now Comcast's customers are paying to use the Internet, to use Netflix, and having to make up for the penalty imposed on Netflix by bandwidth extortion as prices rise. Frustrated, customers switch to the cheaper service, Comcast's. This results in Netflix failing that customer base, Comcast gaining total monopoly over those people, and citizens being locked in a gated Internet community. The Free Market then ceases to function completely.
					<br><br>
					Ex. A small ISP tries to startup after corporations have already begun to rapidly increase bandwidth profit margins. While trying to negotiate bandwidth with a tier 1 backbone provider such as Level3 or Telia, it is determined that no amount of venture capital can afford a transit agreement due to consumer ISPs negotiating higher transit agreements for any data passing through their networks. This small ISP immediately fails.
					<br><br>
					All of the above are possible, and in light of recent trends, likely outcomes.
					<br><br>
					Every one of these potential activities will result in American citizens (and by proxy, citizens of allied countries) suffering reduced access. Or worse, the American people turning their back on the Internet because of mounting fees and costs, leading to an economic collapse in absence of brick and mortar stores to meet demand with supply.
					<br><br>
					All of the above will only be possible if the FCC rolls back the 2015 Common Carrier Rules. Please reconsider your plan, before everyone suffers to support a corporate bottom line that results in a lose-lose for both the economy and the American people.
					<br><br>
					Thank you for your time,
					<br><br>
